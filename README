This is the public API of the IDB core application.

In order to submit maintenace logs from a machine into the IDB application one needs this public API.
It accepts maintenance logs submitted by an LDAP user via the idb-service script, and adds it to an
ActiveMQ queue where it gets polled from the IDB core application.
